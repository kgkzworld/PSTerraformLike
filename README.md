**Why PSTerraformLike?**

PSTerraformLike is a powerful framework that simplifies the usage of Desired State Configuration (DSC)
in PowerShell. It provides a more user-friendly and extensible approach compared to traditional DSC 
frameworks, such as PowerShell DSC.

PSTerraformLike offers a streamlined experience for creating and managing DSC configurations.
It allows you to easily convert any PowerShell function into a DSC resource, making it highly extensible
and adaptable to your specific needs.

**Key features**
KEY FEATURES:
- Easier to Use: PSTerraformLike simplifies the process of working with DSC by providing a more intuitive
	and user-friendly interface. It eliminates the complexities often associated with traditional DSC
	frameworks, allowing you to focus on writing declarative code.

- Extensibility: With PSTerraformLike, you can create DSC resources from any PowerShell function,
    giving you the flexibility to leverage existing code and extend the capabilities of your DSC configurations.

- Standardization: PSTerraformLike promotes standardization by enforcing a consistent structure and format for DSC configurations.
    This ensures that your configurations are easily understandable and maintainable, even in large-scale environments.

- Declarative Coding: By using PSTerraformLike, you can write DSC configurations in a declarative manner,
    specifying the desired state of your systems rather than writing procedural scripts. This approach simplifies the management of
    configuration drift and promotes consistency across your infrastructure.

- Source Control: PSTerraformLike integrates seamlessly with source control systems, allowing you to version and track changes to your
    DSC configurations. This enables collaboration, auditability, and the ability to roll back to previous configurations if needed.

- Change Detection with Runbooks: PSTerraformLike provides built-in functionality to detect changes in your DSC configurations.
    By utilizing runbooks, you can easily identify and remediate any configuration drift, ensuring that your systems remain in the desired state.

- System Checks and Remediation: PSTerraformLike offers a convenient way to perform system checks and flag remediation tasks within
    your runbooks or through the command-line interface (CLI). This simplifies the process of verifying system compliance and automating
    remediation actions.

- Logging: PSTerraformLike offers built-in logging functionality that allows you to easily track changes to your DSC configurations.

- Easy to Use Format: PSTerraformLike supports YAML as an easy-to-use format for defining runbook and DSC configurations.
    This allows you to leverage the simplicity and readability of YAML while benefiting from the power and flexibility of PSTerraformLike.
